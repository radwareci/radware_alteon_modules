    suboptions:
      mode:
        description:
          - Set the high availability mode.
          - Disabled means that High availability is not configured.
          - Switch HA is a switch-based group aggregates all virtual IP addresses on an Alteon as a single entity. The active Alteon supports
            all traffic or services. The backup Alteon acts as a standby for services on the active master Alteon. If the master Alteon fails,
            the backup Alteon takes over processing for all services.
          - Service HA is Several VIPs grouped together and behave as a single entity for failover purposes. A service group is comprised of
            several VIPs and their associated floating IP addresses. You can define up to 64 service groups on a single Alteon platform.
          - Extended HA is an extension of Switch HA mode that enables failover within a cluster of more than two (and up to four) Alteons.
          - Legacy VRRP is A legacy mode that maintains the Alteon high availability module as implemented in software versions earlier than 30.1.
        required: false
        default: null
        choices:
        - disabled
        - vrrp
        - switch
        - service
        - extendedHA
      advertise_bgp_routes_on_backup:
        description:
          - Specifies whether a backup Alteon advertises the virtual IP address (virtual server router) routes to a Border Gateway Protocol peer.
          - This option is intended for cases where bi-directional forwarding (BFD) is activated on BGP peers in a multiple-site topology.
          - When BGP failure detection is faster than high availability failover, this option prevents the BGP router from redirecting traffic to another site.
          - The backup Alteon advertises its virtual IP addresses, but does not process network traffic for these VIPS until it changes roles
            from backup to master
          - (for example, it does not respond to ARPs until it has become active).
          - The purpose of this advertisement is for BGP purposes only, and does not affect Alteon high availability capabilities.
        required: false
        default: disabled
        choices:
        - enabled
        - disabled
      holdoff_timer_second:
        description:
          - Sets the length of time, in seconds, that the master Alteon waits before forwarding traffic to the default gateway and real servers.
        required: false
        default: 0
        type: int
      send_garp_nwclss_proxy_ips:
        description:
          - Specifies whether to send Gratuitous ARP (GARP) messages for all proxy IP addresses in the network class range.
          - Gratuitous ARP packets are used to force a next-hop router to learn an IP and MAC pair.
          - For security reasons, this option can only be used for an IP address belonging to a VIP, PIP, or interface.
        required: false
        default: disabled
        choices:
        - enabled
        - disabled
      advertisement_interval_second:
        description:
          - Sets the length of time, in seconds, between Alteon master advertisements.

      fail_back_mode:
        description:
          - Defines the Alteon failback mode.
          - Onfailure means that failback does not occur if all tracked resources are available on the active Alteon.
          - Always means that failback to the Alteon with preferred state set to active occurs when that Alteon becomes available.
        required: false
        default: onfailure
        choices:
        - onfailure
        - always
      preferred_state:
        description:
          - Defines the Alteon preferred initial state.
          - The preferred initial state is relevant and configurable only when the failback mode is Always.
          - The preferred initial state should be Active for one of the Alteons in an HA pair, and Standby for the other.
          - If both Alteon platforms have the same preferred initial state, the system arbitrarily selects the active Alteon.
        required: false
        default: standby
        choices:
        - active
        - standby
      gateway_tracking_state:

        - disabled
      sync_session_interval_seconds:
        description:
          - Sets the stateful failover update interval in seconds.
          - The active Alteon sends update packets of new persistent binding entries, if any, to the backup Alteon at the specified update interval.
          - This option available only when the Sync Persistent Sessions checkbox is selected.
        required: false
        default: 30
        type: int
      unicast_session_mirroring:
        description:
          - Enables SFO unicast mode.
          - The Unicast Session Mirroring option enables UDP unicast communication between the active and standby Alteons.
          - You must define the interface over which mirroring takes place.
          - Radware recommends defining a secondary interface for backup. Interfaces used for session mirroring must have a peer IP address configured.
        required: false
        default: disabled
        choices:
        - enabled
        - disabled
      mirroring_primary_interface:
        description:
          - Sets the primary interface for unicast session failover.

        required: false
        default: null
        type: int
      cluster_master_election_priority:
        description:
          - Extended HA mode is an extension of Switch HA mode that enables failover within a cluster of more than two (and up to four) Alteons.
          - There is always a single master in a cluster, based on priority and a Failback/Failover order value, as follows
          - When there is a single Alteon with the highest priority, this Alteon becomes the master. (Priority is not configurable, and is
            derived from real servers and gateway tracking.)
          - When multiple Alteons share the highest priority, the Alteon among them with the lowest Failback/Failover order value becomes the master.
          - When multiple Alteons share the highest priority and the lowest Failback/Failover order value, there is an internal bidding process
            that takes place to determine the master.
          - In topologies with multiple Alteon peers, session mirroring should be in broadcast mode, not unicast.
          - To avoid a broadcast storm over the network due to session mirroring, Radware recommends allocating a special VLAN for this purpose.
        required: false
        default: 255
        type: int
      advertising_interfaces:
        description:
          - Sets an IP interface for communication between the Alteon platforms in the HA pair.
          - Make sure that you set a peer IP address for each interface.
          - Radware recommends using more than a single advertisement interface.
        required: false
        default: null
        type: list
        elements: int
      tracked_interfaces:
